Overview: Briefly describe the purpose of the test cases (to cover login and authentication flows).

Test Suites: List each sheet as a test suite and then the test cases within each suite in a table.

We have the following sheets:
1. Login (Valid,Invalid) -> 6 test cases (TC01 to TC06)
2. Forgotten password -> 3 test cases (TC07 to TC09)
3. Password Reset -> 3 test cases (TC10 to TC12)
4. Session Timeout -> 2 test cases (TC13, TC14)
5. Account Lockout -> 2 test cases (TC15, TC16)

For each test suite, we'll create a section with a table that includes:
- Test Case ID
- Test Scenario
- Steps to Execute
- Expected Result
- Priority
- Remarks (if available)

Note: Some sheets have a "Remarks" column and some don't. We'll include it only if present in the original sheet.

Approach: We'll iterate over each sheet and create a table for the test cases in that sheet.

# Authentication Test Cases

This document outlines the test cases for login and authentication functionality.

## Test Suites

### 1. Login (Valid and Invalid)

| TC ID | Test Scenario | Steps to Execute | Expected Result | Priority | Remarks |

|-------|---------------|------------------|-----------------|----------|---------|

| ...   | ...           | ...              | ...             | ...      | ...     |

### 2. Forgotten Password
